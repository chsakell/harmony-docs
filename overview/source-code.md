# ⬇️ Source code

Harmony's source code is available for download or cloning on its GitHub [repository](https://github.com/chsakell/Harmony).

{% hint style="success" %}
**Support Harmony** :clap:\
If you download the source code, you will find an amazing, state of the art solution built with best practices and latest technologies but also a complete product for managing your projects. Harmony used to be a private repository and only available upon purchase, but now it's publicly available for everyone :tada: :sparkles:

It takes a lot of **time** and **effort** to maintain and adding features to such a huge project, so consider showing your appreciation using [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/chsakell) :coffee: or a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/chsakell) tier :pray: :clap:
