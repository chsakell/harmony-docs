# âš™ Setup

Harmony is a web application built with **.NET Core** which means it's cross platform and can be deployed anywhere _(Windows, Linux, Mac)_.&#x20;

Its dependencies are:

* An **SQL Server** which can be installed on Windows or [Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup?view=sql-server-ver16#supportedplatforms).  Read the [databases.md](databases.md "mention") guide for more information about how to setup the required databases
* **RabbitMQ** for asynchronously  exchanging messages between <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony</mark> web app and <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Notifications</mark>. The latter, is the app responsible for sending the email notifications. Read the [rabbitmq.md](rabbitmq.md "mention") section to setup RabbitMQ
* Email service provider: Harmony needs you to configure an email service provider so that it can send the email notifications. Currently Gmail & [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/products/transactional-email/) are supported but it's very easy to add your own provider. Read the  [email-provider.md](email-provider.md "mention") guide for more information about how to setup an email provider
