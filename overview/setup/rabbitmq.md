# ðŸ“¬ RabbitMQ

The best guide for installing RabbitMQ is the official website itself. Please follow the installation guide that fits your environment [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember that RabbitMQ requires that you have also installed [Erlang](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html). Don't worry though, the official website explains everything you need to do

### Broker configuration

Set the **BrokerConfiguration** setting in the _**appsettings.json**_ files in all web application projects. Following is an example for local RabbitMQ configuration.

```json
  "BrokerConfiguration": {
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 5672,
    "Username": "harmony",
    "Password": "my_super_password",
    "VirtualHost": "/"
  }
```
