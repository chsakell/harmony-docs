### \[Version 2.5] - 25 February 2024 <a href="#version-2.5" id="version-2.5"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This version goal is to introduce an <mark style="color:orange;">API Gateway</mark> so there's a **unified point of entry** into harmony system. For this, [Ocelot](https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot) Gateway will be used to:

* Proxy all requests starting with _/core_ to <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark>
* Proxy all requests starting with _/automations_ to <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark>
* Proxy all WebSocket connections to <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Signalr</mark> through Gateway\
  \
  This way, the client only needs to know a single endpoint configuration, the gateway's endpoint. Also the gateway can be used for other reasons in the future, e.g. _caching, rate limiting, service discovery, tracing, load balancer, kubernetes_
{% endhint %}

* [x] Create new project <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.ApiGateway</mark>
* [x] Integrate <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark> to Gateway

* [x] Integrate <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.SignalR</mark> to Gateway
* [x] Dockerize <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.ApiGateway</mark>
* [x] Add **distributed logging** using Elastic Search & Kibana :mag: :rocket:

### &#x20;\[Version 2.4] - 17 February 2024 <a href="#version-2.4" id="version-2.4"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal is to **containerize** Harmony solution :muscle:\
Docker files will be added for every web application in order to define their image build process. Next, a **docker-compose** file will be responsible to define the services and all of their dependencies _(SQL Server, Redis, MongoDB, etc..)_. \
Ideally after this release, you should be able to start Harmony by running the following commands:

```docker
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
{% endhint %}

* [x] Create _Dockerfile_ for <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark>.
* [x] Create _Dockerfile_ for <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.SignalR</mark>.
* [x] Create _Dockerfile_ for <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Client</mark>.
* [x] Create _Dockerfile_ for <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark>.
* [x] Create _Dockerfile_ for <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Notifications</mark>.

### \[Version 2.2] - 26 January 2024 <a href="#version-2.2" id="version-2.2"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal is to integrate [gRPC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) communication between internal microservices. This will finalize the solution design towards a **dockerized** microservice architecture.

* The only application that has direct access to the main harmony database is the <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark>.
* The only application that has direct access to the MongoDB automations database is the <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark>.
* Any interaction between backend microservices should be done through high performant communication using **gRPC** framework :rocket:

\
_**gRPC** is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication._
{% endhint %}

* [x] Expose gRPC services from Harmony.Api.
* [x] Expose gRPC service from Harmony.Automations.
* [x] Remove direct harmony database access from <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark> and consume gRPC service from Harmony.Api instead.
* [x] Remove direct harmony database access from <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Notifications</mark> and consume gRPC service from Harmony.Api instead.
* [x] Remove direct MongoDB database access from <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark> and consume gRPC service from Harmony.Automations instead.

### \[Version 2.1]  - 23 January 2024 <a href="#version-2.1" id="version-2.1"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This version will upgrade the entire solution to .NET 8.0 :rocket: :tada:
{% endhint %}

* [x] Upgrade solution projects to .NET 8.0
* [x] Convert <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Client</mark> to **Standalone Blazor WebAssembly** project.
* [x] Rename <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Server</mark> to **Harmony.API** _(microservice)_.
* [x] Rename Harmony.Server.SignalR to **Harmony.SignalR**.
* [x] Remove all MongoDB database dependencies/access from all projects except from Harmony.Automations _(Harmony.Automations will be a microservice)_.
* [x] Expose HTTP endpoints for internal microservice communication.

### \[Version 2.0] - 20 January 2024 <a href="#version-2.0" id="version-2.0"></a>

> The first rule of any technology used in a business is that **automation** applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that **automation** applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.
>
> [_**Bill Gates**_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

{% hint style="info" %}
This version will bring 3 major upgrades which will level up Harmony even more:

* Add the very first **automation**. The first automation template that will be implemented is the _"<mark style="color:orange;">Auto close parent issue when all sub-tasks are done</mark>"._
* Create a scalable **SignalR** web app responsible for pushing the board related updates to clients.  Another scaling issue to be solved.
{% endhint %}

### \[Version 1.5] - 2 January 2024 <a href="#version-1.5" id="version-1.5"></a>

> _We are searching for some kind of **harmony** between two intangibles: a form which we have not yet designed and a context which we cannot properly describe._\
> \
> [_**Christopher Alexander**_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal is to add a **powerful Search textbox** at the top bar :mag\_right: .  \
Here are some of the features to be implemented in this release:
{% endhint %}

#### Features

* [x] Integrate [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) search engine for super fast indexing & searching capabilities. Algolia is totally [free](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) to use for **10000** requests per month  :muscle: and probably the easiest search engine to configure, existing at the moment
* [x] Implement a database fallback search service in case there's no search engine integration configuration
* [x] Add app bar search textbox for fast results
* [x] Create search modal option for advanced searching scenarios _(based on several criteria, e.g. issue status,  members assigned, board etc.)_&#x20;
* [x] Add **caching** to database operations

For more info on how to setup the search engine read the [search-engine.md](../configuration/dependencies/search-engine.md "mention") docs.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why Algolia & not Elastic Search?**\


* Algolia search is [faster](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/full-text-search-in-your-database-algolia-versus-elasticsearch/), more relevant, and easier to use than Elasticsearch for searching simple database data. Algolia's focus is on getting exceptional results with minimal configuration.&#x20;
* Elasticsearch is more flexible for searching complex data and can be used for a wider range of search applications.
{% endhint %}
