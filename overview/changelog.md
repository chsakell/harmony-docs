# ðŸ”ƒ Changelog

Change log contains all version updates, old, current and upcoming with all important additions, fixes or improvements. The **unchecked** items of the _work in progress_ version, are the items remained before this build is released.

### \[Version 2.3] - In progress _(instantly available with_ [_GitHub_](pricing.md#github-sponsors) _plan)_

{% hint style="info" %}
After working on architectural improvements for a few sprints in a row, it's high time to get back on track and start adding new features :tada:
{% endhint %}

* [x] Display <mark style="color:red;">archived</mark> cards.
* [x] <mark style="color:green;">Re-activate</mark> archived cards by moving them either to a board (Kanban) or to a sprint (Scrum).
* [x] Sync board across all connections upon card creation or archiving.
* [x] Implement **Smart auto-assign** automation.
* [x] Rename **Harmony.Notifications** HangFire database to **Harmony.Jobs** and re-use it in <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark> _(breaking - check databases & SQL Server sections)_.

### \[Version 2.2] - 26 January 2024 <a href="#version-2.2" id="version-2.2"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal is to integrate [gRPC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) communication between internal microservices. This will finalize the solution design towards a **dockerized** microservice architecture.

* The only application that has direct access to the main harmony database is the <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark>.
* The only application that has direct access to the MongoDB automations database is the <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark>.
* Any interaction between backend microservices should be done through high performant communication using **gRPC** framework :rocket:

\
_**gRPC** is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication._
{% endhint %}

* [x] Expose gRPC services from Harmony.Api.
* [x] Expose gRPC service from Harmony.Automations.
* [x] Remove direct harmony database access from <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Automations</mark> and consume gRPC service from Harmony.Api instead.
* [x] Remove direct harmony database access from <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Notifications</mark> and consume gRPC service from Harmony.Api instead.
* [x] Remove direct MongoDB database access from <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Api</mark> and consume gRPC service from Harmony.Automations instead.

### \[Version 2.1]  - 23 January 2024 <a href="#version-2.1" id="version-2.1"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This version will upgrade the entire solution to .NET 8.0 :rocket: :tada:
{% endhint %}

* [x] Upgrade solution projects to .NET 8.0
* [x] Convert <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Client</mark> to **Standalone Blazor WebAssembly** project.
* [x] Rename <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony.Server</mark> to **Harmony.API** _(microservice)_.
* [x] Rename Harmony.Server.SignalR to **Harmony.SignalR**.
* [x] Remove all MongoDB database dependencies/access from all projects except from Harmony.Automations _(Harmony.Automations will be a microservice)_.
* [x] Expose HTTP endpoints for internal microservice communication.

### \[Version 2.0] - 20 January 2024 <a href="#version-2.0" id="version-2.0"></a>

> The first rule of any technology used in a business is that **automation** applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that **automation** applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.
>
> [_**Bill Gates**_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

{% hint style="info" %}
This version will bring 3 major upgrades which will level up Harmony even more:

* Add the very first **automation**. The first automation template that will be implemented is the _"<mark style="color:orange;">Auto close parent issue when all sub-tasks are done</mark>"._
* Create a scalable **SignalR** web app responsible for pushing the board related updates to clients.  Another scaling issue to be solved.
{% endhint %}

Version 2.0 will set things up towards a [**dockerized**](https://www.docker.com/) solution. Sit back and relax, this might take a while.

* [x] Add support for child issues to cards.
* [x] Change issue status from card's view.
* [x] Display total number of child issues per card on board.
* [x] Create [**Harmony.Automations**](../guide/automations.md) project for handling automations.
* [x] Create Automations settings page.
* [x] Create, enable, disable and remove an automation.
* [x] Create [**Harmony.Server.SignalR**](setup/databases/redis.md) project for handling SignalR messages.

### \[Version 1.5] - 2 January 2024 <a href="#version-1.5" id="version-1.5"></a>

> _We are searching for some kind of **harmony** between two intangibles: a form which we have not yet designed and a context which we cannot properly describe._\
> \
> [_**Christopher Alexander**_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal is to add a **powerful Search textbox** at the top bar :mag\_right: .  \
Here are some of the features to be implemented in this release:
{% endhint %}

#### Features

* [x] Integrate [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) search engine for super fast indexing & searching capabilities. Algolia is totally [free](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) to use for **10000** requests per month  :muscle: and probably the easiest search engine to configure, existing at the moment
* [x] Implement a database fallback search service in case there's no search engine integration configuration
* [x] Add app bar search textbox for fast results
* [x] Create search modal option for advanced searching scenarios _(based on several criteria, e.g. issue status,  members assigned, board etc.)_&#x20;
* [x] Add **caching** to database operations

For more info on how to setup the search engine read the [search-engine.md](setup/search-engine.md "mention") docs.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why Algolia & not Elastic Search?**\


* Algolia search is [faster](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/full-text-search-in-your-database-algolia-versus-elasticsearch/), more relevant, and easier to use than Elasticsearch for searching simple database data. Algolia's focus is on getting exceptional results with minimal configuration.&#x20;
* Elasticsearch is more flexible for searching complex data and can be used for a wider range of search applications.

\
<mark style="color:blue;">Who said Harmony won't add Elastic Search support in the future?</mark> :sunglasses:\ <mark style="color:blue;">Harmony is here to stay.</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**Elastic Search**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">support will be added as well.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### \[Version 1.3] - 6 December 2023

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal was to **add email notifications** using Gmail configuration and optional email service provider such as Brevo. For best practices and scaling capabilities, a new project was created, responsible to send the notifications. The entire setup will be based on **RabbitMQ** messaging & **HangFire**.
