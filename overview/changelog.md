# ðŸ”ƒ Changelog

Change log contains all version updates, old, current and upcoming with all important additions, fixes or improvements. The **unchecked** items of the _work in progress_ version, are the items remained before this build is released.

### \[Version 1.5] - Work in progress

> _We are searching for some kind of **harmony** between two intangibles: a form which we have not yet designed and a context which we cannot properly describe._\
> \
> [_**Christopher Alexander**_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

{% hint style="info" %}
This version's goal is to add a **powerful Search textbox** at the top bar :mag\_right: .  \
Here are some of the features to be implemented in this release:
{% endhint %}

#### Features

* [ ] Integrate [Angolia](https://www.algolia.com/) search engine for super fast indexing & searching capabilities. Angolia is totally [free](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) to use for **10000** requests per month  :muscle: and probably the easiest search engine to configure, existing at the moment
* [ ] Implement a database fallback search service in case there's no search engine integration configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why Angolia & not Elastic Search?**\


* Algolia search is [faster](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/full-text-search-in-your-database-algolia-versus-elasticsearch/), more relevant, and easier to use than Elasticsearch for searching simple database data. Algolia's focus is on getting exceptional results with minimal configuration.&#x20;
* Elasticsearch is more flexible for searching complex data and can be used for a wider range of search applications.

\
<mark style="color:orange;">Who said Harmony won't add Elastic Search support in the future?</mark> :sunglasses:\ <mark style="color:orange;">Hamony is here to stay. Elastic Search support will be added as soon as possible.</mark>
