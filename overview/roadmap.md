# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

## Expect to grow fast

Harmony already implements most of a **Kanban** software tool features, such as create a board, add lists and cards to it, add labels, description, due dates, assign members, add check lists and check list items.

**Scrum Projects** are also implemented which means that you are able to create a scrum project, create a backlog, add sprint iterations and everything related to a scrum oriented project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that whenever you buy Harmony, you will be able to download the new releases for free.
{% endhint %}

The main goal is to add most if not all of the basic features someone can find on Trello & Jira.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Other than new features, more UX improvements, bug fixes and performance improvements will be always released\
Expect a release cycle to be about **2-3 weeks**, considering that [Envato](https://codecanyon.net/item/harmony-project-management-tool/49138488) needs a few days to approve the release.
{% endhint %}

### Major milestones coming soon

* [x] **Search Engine integration**: A powerful and super fast search text box will be added to the top bar - Also an advanced search modal will also be implemented for advanced searching scenarios with many criteria _(coming on next_ [_release v1.5_](changelog.md#version-1.5)_)_. &#x20;
* [ ] **Automation**: an automation engine allows users to _automate_ tasks and processes in just a few clicks
* [ ] **Gmail & Facebook login integration**
