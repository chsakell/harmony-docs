# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

## Expect to grow fast

Harmony already implements most of a **Kanban** software tool features, such as create a board, add lists and cards to it, add labels, description, due dates, assign members, add check lists and check list items.

**Scrum Projects** are also implemented and will be available soon on [**Envato**](https://codecanyon.net/item/harmony-project-management-tool/49138488) when the build is approved. This means that you will be able to create a scrum project, create a backlog, sprint iterations and everything related to a scrum oriented project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Seize the opportunity to buy Harmony at the low price of **74$** before scrum projects are approved by Envato _(which is going to happen soon)_. It's very likely that the price will go up after Scrum projects are also available. Remember that whenever you buy Harmony, you will be able to download the new releases for free.
{% endhint %}

The main goal is to add most if not all of the basic features someone can find on Trello & Jira. Here are some of the features to be implemented soon:

* **Scrum Project** support _(done, pending Envato's approval)_
* SendGrid integration
* Email notifications , **HangFire** & **RabbitMQ** integration via new project for scaling&#x20;
* Add reports / charts to display a project's progress through time
* Upgrade to **.NET 8**

{% hint style="info" %}
Other than new features, more UX improvements, bug fixes and performance improvements will be always released\
\
Expect a release cycle to be about **2-3 weeks**, considering that [Envato](https://codecanyon.net/item/harmony-project-management-tool/49138488) needs a few days to approve the release.
