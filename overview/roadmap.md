# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

## Expect to grow fast

Harmony already implements most of a **Kanban** software tool features, such as create a board, add lists and cards to it, add labels, description, due dates, assign members, add check lists and check list items.

The second big milestone though is to add support for **Scrum Projects**. This means that you will be able to create a scrum project, create a backlog, sprint iterations and everything related to a scrum oriented project.

The main goal is to add most of the features someone can find on Trello & Jira. Here are some of the features to be implemented soon:

* SendGrid integration
* Email notifications _(**HangFire** & **RabbitMQ** integration via new project for scaling)_&#x20;
* Scrum Project support
* Upgrade to **.NET 8**
* Add reports / charts to display a project's progress through time

{% hint style="info" %}
Other than new features, more UX improvements, bug fixes and performance improvements will be always released\
\
Expect a release cycle to be about **2-3 weeks**, considering that [Envato](https://codecanyon.net/item/harmony-project-management-tool/49138488) needs a few days to approve the release.
