# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

## Expect to grow fast

Harmony already implements most of a **Kanban** software tool features, such as create a board, add lists and cards to it, add labels, description, due dates, assign members, add check lists and check list items.

**Scrum Projects** are also implemented which means that you are able to create a scrum project, create a backlog, add sprint iterations and everything related to a scrum oriented project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that whenever you buy Harmony, you will be able to download the new releases for free.
{% endhint %}

The main goal is to add most if not all of the basic features someone can find on Trello & Jira. Here are some of the features to be implemented soon:

* Email notifications using Gmail and an optional email service provider such as Brevo. This has currently the **highest priority**. Example: You will be receiving email notifications when an issue's status changes or due date expires.
* Add reports / charts to display a project's progress through time
* Upgrade to **.NET 8**

{% hint style="info" %}
Other than new features, more UX improvements, bug fixes and performance improvements will be always released\
\
Expect a release cycle to be about **2-3 weeks**, considering that [Envato](https://codecanyon.net/item/harmony-project-management-tool/49138488) needs a few days to approve the release.
