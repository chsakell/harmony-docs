Installing Harmony, requires some basic technical knowledge like installing SQL Server & configuring connection strings, but nothing more or difficult than this.

There are detailed [guides](broken-reference) regarding all the prerequisites to configure before running Harmony. For each installation you might need to advice the official provider's documentation, e.g. to install _MongoDB_ server on Windows _(which simply requires to run an executable)_ you can visit MongoDB corresponding official [guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#install-mongodb-community-edition).
