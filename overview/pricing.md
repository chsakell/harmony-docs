In order to get direct access to Harmony's **private** repository, navigate to its creator's sponsorship [page](https://github.com/sponsors/chsakell) and select one of the Harmony's tiers.&#x20;

* **Monthly**: Get access to Harmony's repository for only **10$** per month. Your access is remained as long as you are subscribed to the tier. \
  Choose this tier, if you want to take a look at how an amazing project management tool can be implemented using the latest [technologies](technology.md) and best practices existing for building microservices _(best suitable for developers/engineers/architects)_<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>
* **One-time**: Pay once and get a **life-time** access to the repository.  \
  Choose this tier, if you are interested in both technical and product features in a **long term**.  Harmony will continue to evolve for a long time so with this plan you gain life-time access to code changes, architectural improvements, product additions, bug fixes, etc.\
  There are two one-time plans, <mark style="color:blue;">69$</mark> & <mark style="color:blue;">99$</mark> which work the same _(the latter can be used as a sign of appreciation for this state of the art solution which requires hard work and effort to maintain)._
