# 🐛 Issue tracking

You can use Harmony's GitHub [repositor](https://github.com/chsakell/harmony-docs/issues)[y](../) for creating issues for Harmony.

#### When creating an issue make sure to follow the rules:

{% hint style="warning" %}
* U**se the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.
* Describe step by step the flow to reproduce the issue.
* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests
* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
{% endhint %}

#### Example

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
