# âœ¨ Features

## Kanban Boards

Harmony already implements most features if not all, of a Kanban style project management's tool such as **Trello**. The entire process on how to create workspaces, boards, lists etc.. is described on the **GUIDE** section of the docs. Expect to see a smooth application with instant updates via WebSocket across all board members.

## Scrum Projects

Scrum projects allow you to plan your work in a **backlog** and organize cycles of work into **sprints**. It's recommended for large, complex projects. Harmony's goal is to provide most if not all scrum features provided by **Jira**.&#x20;
