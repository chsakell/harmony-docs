# âœ¨ Features

## Kanban board

Harmony already implements most of a Kanban style project management's tool such as **Trello**. The entire process on how to create workspaces, boards, lists etc.. is described on the **GUIDE** section of the docs. Expect to see a smooth application with instant updates via websockets across all board members.

## Scrum Projects

This is the second milestone for Harmony project management tool. Scrum projects will be supported as soon as passible so stay tuned! Harmony's goal is to provide most if not all scrum features provided by **Jira**.&#x20;
