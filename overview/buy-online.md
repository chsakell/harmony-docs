After completing purchasing, your **GitHub** account will be granted read-only access to the repository in next few hours.

### Envato

Harmony is also available on [**Envato**](https://codecanyon.net/item/harmony-project-management-tool/49138488) market.&#x20;

Regardless the option you choose, after buying the product you will be able to:

* **View & study its full source code**: Thousands of code lines, built with .NET 8.0 and the best available [options](technology.md) _(e.g gRPC)_ for building scalable microservices. In case you are a .NET developer/engineer/architect you are going to love this project.
* **Host your own instance** of Harmony and manage your projects. Take harmony to the next level and try it on your own infrastructure.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Harmony** is an amazing **state of the art** project written with best practices and latest technologies and it's expected to grow more. The price may rise in the future as more and more features are being added.

The **recommended** way to get access to Harmony's source code is using the Harmony **GitHub** sponsor tier instead of Envato market. Here's the benefits you get via GitHub:

* [x] Get instant access to all commits pushed to the repository :muscle:&#x20;
* [x] Better price :moneybag: since there are less fees than Envato
* [x] View **git history** and understand all the changes being made to the repository
* [x] You don't have to wait for Envato's approval process till you get updates
