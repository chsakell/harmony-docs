# ðŸ’¡ What to expect

## Expect to grow fast

Harmony already implements most of a **Kanban** software tool features, such as create a board, add lists and cards to it, add labels, description, due dates, assign members, add check lists and check list items.

The second big milestone though is to add support for **Scrum Projects**. This means that you will be able to create a scrum project, create a backlog, sprints and everything related to a scrum oriented project.
