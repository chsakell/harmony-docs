# Workspaces

Workspaces are containers for boards _(and scrum projects in the future)_. As an admin, it's the first thing you need to create. Members, projects and boards contained to a workspace should be related. For example, if an organization runs projects for both a marketing and an engineering department, then it would make sense to create 2 different workspaces named _Marketing_ & _Engineering_ so that they "host" their related members and projects.
