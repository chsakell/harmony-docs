* **Set from parent if sub-task**: Add an override for sub-tasks and assign their parent's assignee if any.
* **Skip if someone else already assigned**: Skip the trigger if a user is already assigned to the issue. This is used with the **Run trigger** option where you may give some time before running the automation.
