# ðŸ’« Automations

An automations is a no-code rule builder that enables customers to build if-this-then-that-rules based on events in Harmony.

It allows teams to automate their processes, save time, keep Harmony up to date and focus on whatâ€™s most important. :rocket:

The purpose of each automation is to automatically run a task for you, a repetitive operation that you would normally do after certain conditions.&#x20;

Currently there are 2 automations supported, more to come soon!

* [x] [Sync parent and child tasks](sync-parent-and-child-tasks.md)
* [x] [Smart auto-assign](smart-auto-assign.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Automations are stored in a **MongoDB** database so ensure you have [setup](../../overview/setup/databases/mongodb-server.md) all the required dependencies before trying to configure them.
