# ðŸŽ¯ Sprints

Sprints are the core components of a scrum project's board. The board of a scrum project displays items that has been added to sprints which are in **Active** status.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have more than one sprint in **Active** status
{% endhint %}

### Create a sprint

In the Sprints view of a scrum project, click the CREATE SPRINT button. Give a meaningful name for your sprint, an optional goal and a start/end date range. Click the **Create** button to add the sprint to your project.

### Move issues to backlog

If for some reason you want to move some issues from a sprint to the backlog, you can do this by selecting the issues from the sprint, and click the **Move to backlog** from the **ACTIONS** menu.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the sprint that you moved the items from was Active, then the items will also not be visible anymore in the project's board
{% endhint %}

### Complete a sprint

When it's time to complete a sprint, open the **Sprints** view, find the sprint and click the **COMPLETE** button. There are three options for the pending sprint's issues:

1. Move them to an **existing sprint** - available sprints will be shown in the dropdown list.
2. Move them to the **backlog**.
3. Move them to a **new sprint**. The new sprint will be created automatically for you.

{% hint style="info" %}
* You can always edit a sprint's name and date range by clicking the edit icon in the sprints view
* Issues with **Done** status won't be moved
{% endhint %}
