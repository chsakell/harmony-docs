# ðŸŽ¯ Sprints

Sprints are the core components of a scrum project's board. The board of a scrum project displays items that has been added to sprints which are in **Active** status.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have more than one sprint in **Active** status

### Move issues to backlog

If for some reason you want to move some issues from a sprint to the backlog, you can do this by selecting the issues from the sprint, and click the **Move to backlog** from the **ACTIONS** menu.

If the sprint that you moved the items from was Active, then the items will also not be visible anymore in the project's board
