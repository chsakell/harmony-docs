{% hint style="info" %}
* When you create a Scrum project, 3 board lists are being created automatically for you: _**TODO**_, _**IN PROGRESS**_ & **DONE**.
* Every issue that reaches the DONE list is marked as **completed**. This is important to remember when you want to **complete** a sprint. Issues that aren't in the _Done_ list are considered pending and can be moved to an existing or a new sprint or in the backlog during sprint's completion.
