## Overview

<mark style="color:blue;">**Harmony**</mark> is a project management tool to manage your projects.

It can be used by large organizations to manage projects across their teams or by developers to manage their own projects.

You can create workspaces, **Kanban** boards, **Scrum** projects, lists, cards, add members, attachments, labels, check lists/items, due dates, comments and many more.

The source code is fully available after [purchase](overview/buy-online.md) and of course you get updates every time a new release is available! :tada: This means you can host your own instance of **Harmony** rather than paying paid services.
