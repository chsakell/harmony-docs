Harmony
{% endembed %}

## Overview

[<mark style="color:blue;">**Harmony**</mark>](http://demo.harmony-teams.com/) is a project management tool to manage your projects.

It can be used by large organizations to manage projects across their teams or by developers to manage their own projects.

You can create workspaces, **Kanban** boards, **Scrum** projects with sprints & retrospectives :tada:, lists, cards, add members, attachments, labels, check lists/items, due dates, comments and many more.

:battery: Batteries included! Harmony supports [automations](guide/automations/ "mention") & [github.md](integrations/github.md "mention") integration!! :rocket:

The [source code](https://github.com/chsakell/Harmony) is fully available :tada: This means you can host your own instance of **Harmony** rather than paying paid services.

Built using .NET 8.0, latest technologies, best patterns and practices for microservices architecture, [Docker](configuration/docker/) & [Kubernetes](configuration/docker/kubernetes.md) support comes out of the box :whale: :ship::muscle:
