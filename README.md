## Overview

Harmony is a project management tool to manage your projects.

It can be used by large organizations to manage projects across their teams or by developers to manage their own projects&#x20;

> You can create workspaces, boards, lists, cards, add members, labels, check lists/items, due dates and many more.

> The source code is fully available upon purchase and of course you get updates every time a new release is available. This means you can host your own instance of Harmony rather than paying paid services per month.
